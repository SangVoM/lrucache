What is an LRU Cache?
An LRU Cache, or Least Recently Used Cache, is a data structure that stores information in the order that it has most recently been added or accessed.

A popular analogy is a clothes rack in a closet: as clothes are worn and hung back up, they go on the right side of the rack. As time goes on, one can easily tell which clothes haven't been worn in a longer period of time by looking at the left side of the rack.
